\beginverse
When the da\[C]ys are cold
And the car\[G]ds all fold
And the sai\[A&]nts we see
Are all ma\[F]de of gold
When your d\[C]reams all fail
And the one\[G]s we hail
Are the wor\[A&]st of all
And the bl\[F]ood's run stale
\endverse

\beginverse
\[C]  I wanna hide the \[G]truth
I wanna shelter \[A&]you
But with the beast \[F]inside
There's nowhere we can \[C]hide
No matter what we \[G]breed
We still are made of \[A&]greed
This is my kingdom \[F]come
This is my kingdom \[C]come
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[C]  When you feel my \[G]heat
Look into my \[A&]eyes
It's where my demons \[F]hide
It's where my demons \[C]hide
Don't get too \[G]close
It's dark in\[A&]side
It's where my demons \[F]hide
It's where my demons \[C]hide
\endchorus

\beginverse
When the cu\[C]rtain's call
Is the last\[G] of all
When the li\[A&]ghts fade out
All the si\[F]nners crawl
So they du\[C]g your grave
And the mas\[G]querade
Will come c\[A&]alling out
At the mes\[F]s you made
\endverse

\beginverse
\[C]  Don't wanna let you \[G]down
But I am hell \[A&]bound
Though this is all for \[F]you
Don't wanna hide the \[C]truth
No matter what we \[G]breed
We still are made of \[A&]greed
This is my kingdom \[F]come
This is my kingdom \[C]come
\endverse

\refchorus

\beginverse
\[C]  They say it's what you \[G]make
I say it's up to \[A&]fate
It's woven in my \[F]soul
I need to let you \[C]go
Your eyes, they shine so \[G]bright
I wanna save that \[A&]light
I can't escape this now
Unless you show me \[C]how
\endverse
